# Etch-A-Sketch
A simple Etch-A-Sketch program using CSS grid. When the user holds down the mouse on the canvas, the cells in 
the canvas will turn into the color the user has selected. They can choose a color, set a rainbow option, or an eraser option. 

The grid starts off with a 16x16 canvas, but can be increased or decreased by the user (no bigger than 20 since we start 
running into performence issues at that point).
