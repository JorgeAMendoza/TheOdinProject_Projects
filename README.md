# TheOdinProject Curriculum
This repository contains projects from The Odin Project curriculum. The projects in the curriculum demonstrate that I 
can perform web develoment task such as working with REST API, create responsive pages, design pages and create the HTML markup and CSS, and work with various web development tools. 

# JavaScript Library

# Youtube Clone
A simple youtube clone with mobile responsivness, and a youtube video injected with the iFrame element. 

# Etch-A-Sketch
A simple Etch-A-Sketch program using CSS grid. When the user holds down the mouse on the canvas, the cells in 
the canvas will turn into the color the user has selected. They can choose a color, set a rainbow option, or an eraser option. 

The grid starts off with a 16x16 canvas, but can be increased or decreased by the user (no larger than 20x20 since performence issues start to
occur at this amount). 

This project was completed months ago, but I refactored it to be structured as the module revealing pattern. The functions to write on the canvas are in their 
own module, while the functions to change the brush color are in their own module as well.
